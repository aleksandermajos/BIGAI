# BIGAISCHOOL ML.DL ENGINEER COURSE

Every jupyter notebook exist here in this repo will be comprising methods from ENGINE.
It is divided into specific subject use later on with specific IT roles
This course will end with Google TensorFlow Developer Certificate.
It will contain code in Tensorflow/Keras, Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, JAX

Each Jupyter Notebook will contain standarize structure:
-Word explanation
-Pictures explanation
-Animation explanationGIF/ VideoYT
-Math Formula
-Link to external resources
-Implementation
-Use case(s)
