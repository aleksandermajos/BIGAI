# BIGAI
### MODULAR FRAMEWORK BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING(LLM) ALGORITHMS FOR FAST PROTOTYPING

### MAIN MODULES:
* SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND FOR TESTING NEW CODE (USUALLY IN JUPYTER FORMAT) AND POSSIBLY CREATE NEW METHODS FOR ENGINE.
* ENGINE - TESTED METHODS FOR LATER USE BY PROJECTS
* FRONT - FRONTEND FOR PROJECTS.RECENTLY ALOHAPP AND QUANTMAVERICK
* MODELS - TRAINED MODELS AS WEIGHTS MOSTLY FOR PYTORCH
* DATA - DATA STORAGE FOR SMALL FILES


### TO DO IN BIGAI ENGINE:
* LOCAL MISTRAL 8x7B ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥
* LOCAL UNCENSORED LLAMA3_8B DOLPHIN ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥
* OUTSIDE CLAUDE HAIKU CODING AND PIC RECOGNIZE
* LOCAL CREWAI TESTING FOR COOPERATION
* LOCAL AUTOGEN TESTING FOR COOPERATION
* LOCAL SWARMS TESTING FOR COOPERATION
* LOCAL SWA-AGENT TESTING COOPERATION
* LOCAL LANGCHAIN TESTING FOR COOPERATION
* LANGGRAPH FOR BUILDING LLM APPS
* LANGSMITH FOR LLM APPS INTO PRODUCTION
* LOCAL GENERATE OVER 5000-10000 SIMPLE METHODS BASED ON HACKERRANK,CODILITY,LEETCODE,CODEWARS ETC
* LOCAL GENERATE DATA: PROBLEM TO SOLVE AND "RIGHT PATH IN GRAPH"
* VISUALIZE "RIGHT PATH IN GRAPH"
* TRAIN LLM FROM SCRATCH TO GENERATE (SIMILAR TO LANGUAGE-5000 NODES vs 5000 WORDS) POTENTIAL GRAPH PATH
* IDENTIFY EMPTY SLOTS IN GRAPH TO SOLVE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND TRY TO FILL THEM
* LOCAL STT WHISPERX WITH VAD
* OUTSIDE TTS OPENAI
* LOCAL TRANSLATE ???
* BIGAI_SCHOOL PROTOTYPE.EXPLAIN THE CODE USING VOICE AND TEXT, VISUALIZE SOLUTION, BE HELPER USED BIGAI
* REAL TEST OF BIGAI_SCHOOL FOR @TENSORFLOW DEVELOPER CERTIFICATE PASS
* LOCAL PIC GEN STABLE DIFFUSION 3.0
* LOCAL RAG ???
* LOCAL TIMESERIES MODEL ???
* LOCAL ADDING BIG NODES TO THE GRAPH
* ANALYZE EXISTING GITHUB REPO AS GRAPH OF USEFUL METHODS
* LOCAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODEL FOR WALKING "UNUSUAL" PATHS FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEM
* GENERATE FLET CODE
* GENERATE GLUE CODE
* ALOHAPP PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* QUANTMAVERICK PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* BIGAI_ENGINE PROTOTYPE READY FOR BUSINESS USE
* SAMURAI PROTOTYPE
