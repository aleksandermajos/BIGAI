# BIGAI
### MODULAR FRAMEWORK BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING(LLM) ALGORITHMS FOR FAST PROTOTYPING

### MAIN MODULES:
* SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND FOR TESTING NEW CODE (USUALLY IN JUPYTER FORMAT) AND POSSIBLY CREATE NEW METHODS FOR ENGINE.
* ENGINE - TESTED METHODS FOR LATER USE BY PROJECTS
* FRONT - FRONTEND FOR PROJECTS.RECENTLY ALOHAPP AND QUANTMAVERICK
* MODELS - TRAINED MODELS AS WEIGHTS MOSTLY FOR PYTORCH
* DATA - DATA STORAGE FOR SMALL FILES


### TO DO IN BIGAI ENGINE:
* LOCAL MISTRAL 8x7B ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥
* LOCAL LLAMA3_8B_Q5,LLAMA3_70B_Q4_K_S ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥

* LOCAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODEL FOR WALKING "UNUSUAL" PATHS FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEM
* GENERATE FLET CODE
* GENERATE GLUE CODE
* ALOHAPP PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* QUANTMAVERICK PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* BIGAI_ENGINE PROTOTYPE READY FOR BUSINESS USE
* SAMURAI PROTOTYPE
