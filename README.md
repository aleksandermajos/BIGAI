# BIGAI
### MODULAR FRAMEWORK BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING(LLM) ALGORITHMS FOR FAST PROTOTYPING

### MAIN MODULES:
* SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND FOR TESTING NEW CODE (USUALLY IN JUPYTER FORMAT) AND POSSIBLY CREATE NEW METHODS FOR ENGINE.
* ENGINE - TESTED METHODS FOR LATER USE BY PROJECTS
* FRONT - FRONTEND FOR PROJECTS.RECENTLY ALOHAPP AND QUANTMAVERICK
* MODELS - TRAINED MODELS AS WEIGHTS MOSTLY FOR PYTORCH
* DATA - DATA STORAGE FOR SMALL FILES


### TO DO IN BIGAI ENGINE:
* LOCAL MISTRAL 8x7B ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥
* LOCAL UNCENSORED LLAMA3_8B DOLPHIN ON LLAMA_CPP WITH MULTI GPU SUPPORT -->🔥 DONE 🔥
* OUTSIDE CLAUDE HAIKU CODING AND PIC RECOGNIZE
* OUTSIDE CREWAI TESTING FOR CODE CREATION

* LOCAL STT WHISPERX WITH VAD
* OUTSIDE TTS OPENAI
* LOCAL TRANSLATE ???
* LOCAL PIC GEN STABLE DIFFUSION 3.0
* LOCAL RAG ???
* LOCAL TIMESERIES MODEL ???
* LOCAL GRAPH NN MODEL
* LOCAL REINFORCEMENT LEARNING MODEL
* GENERATE FLET CODE
* GENERATE GLUE CODE
* GENERATE REASONING GRAPH
* ALOHAPP PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* BIGAI_SCHOOL PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
* QUANTMAVERICK PROTOTYPE USED BIGAI
