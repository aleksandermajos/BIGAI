### MODULAR FRAMEWORK BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING(LLM) ALGORITHMS FOR FAST PROTOTYPING

### MAIN MODULES:
* SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND FOR TESTING NEW CODE (USUALLY IN JUPYTER FORMAT) AND POSSIBLY CREATE NEW METHODS FOR ENGINE.
* ENGINE - TESTED METHODS FOR LATER USE BY PROJECTS
* FRONT - FRONTEND FOR PROJECTS.RECENTLY ALOHAPP AND QUANTMAVERICK
* MODELS - TRAINED MODELS AS WEIGHTS MOSTLY FOR PYTORCH
* DATA - DATA STORAGE FOR SMALL FILES
* BUSINESS - DESKTOP/WEB APP BASED ON FLET AS HUB FOR GATHERING ALL MY PROJECTS IN ONE PLACE

* STARTUP - WEB/DESKTOP APP FOR ANALIZE EXISTING STARTUPS.IF NECESSARY REVERSE ENGINEERING
