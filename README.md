# BIGAI
### MODULAR FRAMEWORK BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING AND DEEP LEARNING(LLM) ALGORITHMS FOR FAST PROTOTYPING

*⭐️ INSTALL REQUIREMENTS:*
pip install -r requirements_{your_operating_system}.txt

*⭐️ RECREATE CONDA ENVIROMENT:*
conda env create -f BIGAI_{your_operating_system}.yml

*⭐️ STARTING POINT:*
BIGAI/SCHOOL/NOTEBOOKS/ANY.ipynb
or
BIGAI/ENGINE/ANY.py

### MAIN MODULES:
* SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND FOR TESTING NEW CODE (USUALLY IN JUPYTER FORMAT) AND POSSIBLY CREATE NEW METHODS FOR ENGINE.
* ENGINE - TESTED METHODS FOR LATER USE BY PROJECTS
* FRONT - FRONTEND FOR PROJECTS.RECENTLY ALOHAPP AND QUANTMAVERICK
* MODELS - TRAINED MODELS AS WEIGHTS MOSTLY FOR PYTORCH
* DATA - DATA STORAGE FOR SMALL FILES
