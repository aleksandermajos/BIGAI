This suggests that, as amoeboid cells are less contractile, while mesenchymal
cells are more contractile, and there may be a switching between amoeboid and mesenchymal
migration, perhaps there can also be a switching between the dominance of chemotaxis (amoeboid
migration) and contact guidance (mesenchymal migration) [60]. One of the most interesting 2D
platforms, allowing to study contact guidance and chemotaxis, was proposed in [57], in which the
authors demonstrated an additive effect of chemical gradients and fiber alignment by measuring
the persistence time; they also observed that cells were directed by fiber alignment and there was
no effect of the chemical gradient when fibers were aligned perpendicular to it. A similar setting
was also used for studying the dependence of contact guidance on the cell cycle [48]. However, In
the case of different multi-directional cues, totally different scenarios may happen, e.g. in [51] it is
shown that for contact guidance and electrotaxis in the cornea, electrotaxis wins when competing
with the direction of alignment of the fibers.
Multi-cue kinetic model with non-local sensing for cell
migration on a fibers network with chemotaxis

Abstract
Cells perform directed motion in response to external stimuli that they detect by sensing
the environment with their membrane protrusions. In particular, several biochemical and biophysical cues give rise to tactic migration in the direction of their specific targets. This defines
a multi-cue environment in which cells have to sort and combine different, and potentially
competitive, stimuli. We propose a non-local kinetic model for cell migration in presence of
two external factors both influencing cell polarization: contact guidance and chemotaxis. We
propose two different sensing strategies and we analyze the two resulting models by recovering
the appropriate macroscopic limit in different regimes, in order to see how the size of the cell,
with respect to the variation of both external fields, influences the overall behavior. Moreover,
we integrate numerically the kinetic transport equation in a two-dimensional setting in order
to investigate qualitatively various scenarios.

1 Introduction
Cell migration is a fundamental mechanism in a huge variety of processes, such as embryogenesis,
wound healing, angiogenesis, immune response and tumor stroma formation and metastasis.
During such processes, cells sense the environment and respond to external factors that induce
a certain direction of motion towards specific targets (taxis): this results in a persistent migration
in a certain preferential direction. The guidance cues leading to directed migration may be biochemical or biophysical. Biochemical cues can be, for example, soluble factors or growth factors
that give rise to chemotaxis, which involves a mono-directional stimulus. Other cues generating mono-directional stimuli include, for instance, bound ligands to the substratum that induce
haptotaxis, durotaxis, that involves migration towards regions with an increasing stiffness of the
ECM, electrotaxis, also known as galvanotaxis, that prescribes a directed motion guided by an
electric field or current, or phototaxis, referring to the movement oriented by a stimulus of light
[34]. Important biophysical cues are some of the properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM),
first among all the alignment of collagen fibers and its stiffness. In particular, the fiber alignment is shown to stimulate contact guidance [22, 21]. Contact guidance is a key mechanism in a
number of in vivo situations in which cells tend to migrate crawling on the fibers, thus following

the directions imposed by the network structure of the ECM. This is a bi-directional cue, as, if
the fibers network is not polarized, there is no preferential sense of migration along them. For
example, during wound healing fibroblasts migrate efficiently along collagen or fibronectin fibers
in connective tissues; in cancer spread and metastasis formation, cancer cells migrate through the
stromal tissue and are thus facilitated to reach blood and lymphatic vessels [55, 49, 50].
In many processes there are several directional cues that may induce different simultaneous
stimuli. While the cell response to each of them has been largely studied, from both an intracellular
and a migrative point of view, cell responses to a multi-cue environment are much less understood.
The fundamental issue is the way cells rank, integrate or hierarchize multiple cues, in particular
when these give conflicting stimuli, because, for example, they are not co-aligned [51]. Some
studies have shown that there may be competition or cooperation between different stimuli in
the directional response of a cell in a multi-cue environment. Considering the angle between the
relative orientation of the directional cues, in the mono-directional case they compete when this
angle is π, whereas they collaborate when this angle is 0. Bi-directional cues, such as contact
guidance, compete when the angle is π/2. Then, many intermediate scenarios may happen and
guidance stimuli submit or prevail according to other factors, among all their average concentration
and intensity, that relates to the steepness of the gradient for taxis processes and to the degree
of alignment for contact guidance. In particular, regarding the external environment, the average
value of the directional cue (fiber density, molecule concentration, etc.) and the steepness of
the gradient, or the degree of fiber alignment, are fundamental parameters that can be quantified.
While, for cell migration, the angle between the polarization direction and the preferential direction
imposed by the guidance cue can be measured, as well as the displacement, the mean squared
displacement and the persistence time [15]. However, in general, when cues are aligned, a simple
additive mechanism is not what governs multi-cue migration [34], even if it is weighted by the
average cue concentrations or intensities.
In the framework of kinetic models, in the present paper we will focus on how the environmental
sensing of two different stimuli over a finite radius can influence the choice of the direction of
motion of a cell. In particular, we combine chemotaxis, a mono-directional biochemical cue, with
contact guidance, defining the new orientation of the cells as a result of the sensing of the two
cues over a finite neighborhood, that gives a non-local character to the model. In particular,
the combination of chemotaxis and contact-guidance happens in vivo in a variety of situations,
for example in wound healing and in breast cancer. In wound healing, fibers guide cells towards
the provisional clot, whilst in breast cancer cells follow the aligned fibers at the tumor-stroma
interface for migrating out of the primary tumor. Chemotaxis accelerates and enhances these
processes [34, 6, 49, 50]. Therefore, a deep understanding of multi-cue migrational responses is a
key step for the comprehension of both physiologic and pathologic processes, but also for building
engineered tissues, as their structure is realized for guiding cell migration in a focused way [34].
There are not many experimental studies concerning chemotaxis and contact guidance, as well
as other combinations of directional guidances cues [34]. One of the main reasons is the difficulty in
designing environments for controlling multiple directional cues, in particular soluble factors and
aligned fibers and fibrous materials. For example, in one of the first works studying in vitro contact
guidance of neutrophil leukocytes on fibrils of collagen [59], it is shown that migration is more
efficient in the direction of alignment, instead of in the perpendicular direction; in the presence
of chemotaxis, obtained by adding a chemoattractant, they observe that these cues cooperate or
compete in dependence on their relative orientation. In particular, the chemotactic response is
lower for cells trying to cross fibers in the perpendicular direction. In [6], it is shown that alignment
along the fibers is greater in presence of a co-aligned chemoattractant. In [38], the authors study
how multiple uniformly distributed cues quantitatively regulate random cell migration. One of the
latest works concerning the competition between chemotaxis and contact guidance shows that less
contractile cells are dominated by chemotaxis, while contact guidance might dominate in more
contractile cells [52]. This suggests that, as amoeboid cells are less contractile, while mesenchymal
cells are more contractile, and there may be a switching between amoeboid and mesenchymal
migration, perhaps there can also be a switching between the dominance of chemotaxis (amoeboid
migration) and contact guidance (mesenchymal migration) [60]. One of the most interesting 2D
2
platforms, allowing to study contact guidance and chemotaxis, was proposed in [57], in which the
authors demonstrated an additive effect of chemical gradients and fiber alignment by measuring
the persistence time; they also observed that cells were directed by fiber alignment and there was
no effect of the chemical gradient when fibers were aligned perpendicular to it. A similar setting
was also used for studying the dependence of contact guidance on the cell cycle [48]. However, In
the case of different multi-directional cues, totally different scenarios may happen, e.g. in [51] it is
shown that for contact guidance and electrotaxis in the cornea, electrotaxis wins when competing
with the direction of alignment of the fibers.
There is a huge variety of mathematical models concerning cell migration. They range from
microscopic models (also called individuals based models), that describe migration at the cell
level, up to macroscopic ones, that describe collective cell-migration at a tissue level. There are
many examples of individual based models regarding chemotaxis ([14, 23] and references therein)
and migration on the ECM [11, 54, 53]. Concerning macroscopic models, first among all the
famous Keller and Segel model is a drift-diffusion model postulated at the macroscopic level
[29]. Many efforts were made in order to encompass the defects of the Keller and Segel model,
as well as for deriving it from lower scale models (see [30, 27, 40, 41] and references therein).
Between microscopic and macroscopic models there are mesoscopic models that are an intermediate
representative scale, as they include microscopic dynamics and describe the statistical distribution
of the individuals. They also allow, for instance in the case of kinetic theory, to recover the
appropriate macroscopic regime which inherit some details of the microscopic dynamics, thus
giving more significance to some of the parameters [40]. Some examples are [12, 7, 17]. The two
major models for contact guidance at the mesoscopic level were proposed in [24] and [16], both
local models in the physical space. Concerning multiple cues, not many models exist. In [31], the
authors propose a macroscopic drift-diffusion model derived from a space jump process in which
they include the response to multiple chemicals. A recent review for macroscopic PDEs including
multiple-taxis has been proposed in [32]. In [58], the authors propose one of the first models for
both contact guidance and chemotaxis, derived from a microscopic dynamics description. In a
recent work [1], the authors propose a microscopic stochastic model for studying contact guidance
and add chemotaxis in order to study migration at the tumor-stroma interface for classifying TACS
(tumor associated collagen signature). In [8], a kinetic model for cell-cell interactions on a fibers
network in presence of a tactic cue is considered. In [36, 37], the authors propose a non-local
kinetic model with a double biasing cue: the first one affecting the choice of the direction and
the second one affecting the speed, including, through the non-locality, the sensing of macroscopic
quantities performed by the cell, that depends on the cell size, i.e., on its maximum protrusion
length.
As already stated, in this paper we want to include chemotaxis and contact guidance as directional cues guiding cell polarization. In particular, we analyze two possible sensing strategies
that a cell could apply for exploring the neighborhood around, and that determine the choice
for the transition probability for the transport model. The cell can measure the guidance cues
independently, and, then, choose the new orientation using the collected information, eventually
weighted in different ways. Otherwise, it can measure the two directional stimuli, weighting them
equally, and assuming a conditioning of one cue on the other. Therefore, cell response is related to
the choice of the sensing strategy, and the macroscopic overall effect of the two cues would also be
affected. Moreover, we shall consider for the first time a non-local sensing of the fibers distribution
defined at a mesoscopic level; this allows for many intermediate scenarios in the analysis about
the collaborative or competitive effect of the cues. For a better understanding, we discuss how
the choices made on the transition probability, together with the size of the sampling volume and
the characteristics of the two cues determine the macroscopic behavior. Specifically, in section
2, we shall present the mathematical framework, while in section 3 we shall introduce the two
classes of models, that describe the different strategies for the sensing of a double cue, along with
the corresponding macroscopic limits in various regimes, depending on the cell size and on the
variability of the external cues. In section 4, some numerical simulations of the kinetic models will
be presented for investigating qualitatively various scenarios in a two-dimensional setting.

2 Mathematical framework
2.1 The transport model
The cell population will be described at a mesoscopic level through the distribution density p =
p(t, x, v, vˆ) that, for every time t > 0 and position x ∈ Ω ⊆ R
d
, gives the statistical distribution
of the speeds v ∈ [0, U], where U is the maximal speed a cell can achieve, and of the polarization
directions vˆ ∈ S
d−1
, being S
d−1
the unit sphere boundary in R
d
. The velocity vector, thus, will
be given by v = vvˆ.
Then, a macroscopic description for the cell population can be classically recovered through
the definition of moments of the distribution function p. In particular, we recover the cell number

The mesoscopic model consists in the transport equation for the cell distribution
∂p
∂t(t, x, v, vˆ) + v · ∇p(t, x, v, vˆ) = J [p](t, x, v, vˆ) (5)
where the operator ∇ denotes the spatial gradient, so that the term v·∇p takes into account the free
particle transport. The term J [p](t, x, v, vˆ) is the turning operator that describes the scattering of
the microscopic velocity in direction and speed. This is related to the typical microscopic dynamics
of the cell, that is the run and tumble [5, 2]. The run and tumble prescribes an alternation of
runs over straight lines and re-orientations: the choice of the new direction may be random or it
may be biased by the presence of external factors, that may attract or repel the cell as well as
increase the time spent in a run. The run and tumble is classically modeled by a scattering of the
microscopic velocity called velocity jump process [56], characterized by a turning frequency µ and
a transition probability T. The general form of the turning operator which implements a velocity
jump process at a kinetic level is given by

as classically done in the pioneering work concerning kinetic equations for velocity jump processes
[56, 42, 24]. This assumption, along with the assumption on the turning frequency, is due to the
fact that we shall consider directional cues which are sensed non-locally, and, therefore, the most
relevant aspect will be the measured preferential direction instead than the incoming velocity. The
latter (8) allows to write the turning operator as

Arguing as in [46, 4], we can prove a linear version of the classical H-Theorem for the linear
Boltzmann equation (5)-(9) with p
0 = p(0, x, v, vˆ) ∈ L

(Ω × [0, U] × S
d−1
). In particular the
Maxwellian
M(x, v, vˆ) = ρ
∞(x)T(x, v, vˆ),
making the turning operator vanish, is the local asymptotic stable equilibrium of the system. As
already remarked by [36], this implies that T is the local asymptotic equilibrium steady state of
the system. Therefore UT and DT are the mean velocity and diffusion tensor of the cell population
at equilibrium.
2.2 Boundary conditions
Since we are going to consider two-dimensional bounded domains without loss of cells and no
cells coming in, we shall assume conservation of mass. Therefore, we will require that the chosen
boundary condition is no-flux [47]

conditions is part of the wider class of non-absorbing boundary conditions. Denoting the boundary
operator as
R[p](t, x, v, vˆ) = p(t, x, v0
, vˆ
0
),
there are two important classes of kinetic boundary conditions which satisfy (12): the regular
reflection boundary operators and the non-local (in velocity) boundary operators of diffusive type.
We address the reader to the works [45] and [35] for the definition of these boundary operators.
In the present work, we shall consider specular reflection boundary conditions

that means that cells are reflected with an angle of π/2 when they hit the wall.

2.3 Macroscopic limits
In order to investigate the overall trend of the system, the macroscopic behavior is typically
analyzed. By integrating Eq. (5) with (9) on S
d−1 × [0, U], thanks to Eq. (7), we have that
∂tρ(t, x) + ∇ · (ρ(t, x)U(t, x)) = 0 ,
i.e., the mass is conserved pointwise and in the entire domain, because of no-flux boundary
conditions (after integration on Ω). If we multiply Eq. (5) with (9) by vvˆ, and we then integrate
the result on S
d−1 × [0, U], we see that the momentum is not conserved
∂tρ(t, x)U(t, x) + ∇ · (ρ(t, x)DT (t, x)) = µ(x) (ρ(t, x)UT (x) − ρ(t, x)U(t, x)).
We can observe that, if we multiply the transport equations by increasing orders n of power of
v and, then, we integrate on the velocity space, we obtain a non-closed system of macroscopic
equations, since the equations describing the evolution of n
th moment of p contain the (n + 1)th
moment. Therefore, we need some procedures to obtain a closed evolution equation (or system of
equations) for the macroscopic quantities. In particular, we are interested in the evolution of ρ(t, x)
in the emerging regime of the system. Therefore, we shall consider a diffusive or a hydrodynamic
scaling of the transport equation (5) with (9), resulting from a proper non-dimensionalization
of the system. Diffusive and hydrodynamic limits for transport equations with velocity jump
processes have been widely treated in [26, 40, 24, 36]. Formally, we introduce a small parameter
  1 and we re-scale the spatial variable as
ξ = x, (14)
being ξ the macroscopic spatial variable. According to the other characteristic quantities of the
system of study, the macroscopic time scale τ will be
τ = 
2
t, (15)
that is the parabolic scaling representing a diffusion dominated phenomenon, or
τ = t, (16)
that is the hyperbolic scaling that represents a drift driven phenomenon. Up to the spatial scaling
(14), we have that the transition probability may be expanded as
T(ξ, v, vˆ) = T0(ξ, v, vˆ) + T1(ξ, v, vˆ) + O(
2
).
Therefore, the corresponding means and diffusion tensors will be given by

Considering a Hilbert expansion of the distribution function p
p = p0 + p1 + O(

if there is conservation of mass, we have that all the mass is in p0 [26], i.e.,
ρ0 = ρ, ρi = 0 ∀i ≥ 1 , (20)
where ρi =

The functional solvability condition that is necessary for performing a diffusive limit (i.e., for
choosing τ = 

U0
T = 0, (21)
meaning that the leading order of the drift vanishes, which is coherent with the fact that the time
scale τ = 

t is chosen because the phenomenon macroscopically is diffusion-driven. The diffusive
limit procedure prescribes to re-scale (5)-(9) with (14)-(15) and to insert (19) in the re-scaled

3 A mathematical model for chemotaxis on a fibers network
In this section, we shall introduce the transition probability modeling a decision process of a cell in
presence of a double directional guidance cue: a fibrous ECM and a chemoattractant. In particular,
we shall consider amoeboid cells [60] moving by contact guidance without proteolysis: cells hit
the fiber and then move along the direction of the fiber itself. It has been shown experimentally,
for example in the case of glioma cancer cells [28], that randomly disposed fibers imply isotropic
diffusion of cells, while aligned fibers cause anisotropic diffusion of cells along the preferential
direction of the fibers themselves. The first transport model for contact guidance was proposed by
[24], further studied and developed by [43, 8, 9] and applied to the study of glioma by [44, 20, 19,
13, 18]. The model proposed by [24] prescribes a distribution of fibers on the space of directions,
given by the unit sphere in R
n,
q = q(x, vˆ), x ∈ Ω, vˆ ∈ S
d−1
(24)
that satisfies
Q1: q(x, vˆ) > 0, ∀x ∈ Ω, vˆ ∈ S
d−1
Q2: Z
S
d−1
q(x, vˆ) dvˆ = 1, ∀x ∈ Ω
Q3: q(x, vˆ) = q(x, −vˆ), ∀x ∈ Ω, vˆ ∈ S
d−1
,
where the last condition means that we are considering a non-polarized network of fibers, so that
cells are able to go in both senses in every direction. Being, then, q(x, vˆ) a probability density, we
can define the mean direction of the fibers
Eq(x) = Z
S
d−1
q(x, vˆ) vˆ dvˆ, (25)
and the diffusion tensor of the fibers, given by the variance-covariance matrix of q
Dq(x) = Z
S
d−1
q(x, vˆ) (vˆ − Eq) ⊗ (vˆ − Eq) dvˆ . (26)
As we consider a non polarized fibers network, we have that
Eq(x) = 0, (27)
meaning that there is no mean direction in the dynamics. The tensor (26) is symmetric and
positive definite, when q is a regular probability distribution, and, thus, it is diagonalizable. Each
eigenvalue represents the diffusivity in the direction of the corresponding eigenvector, meaning
that, if the eigenvalues are equal, there is isotropic diffusion, while, if they are different, there is a
preferential direction of motion, i.e. anisotropy. Therefore, the model introduced in [24], as shown
in [43], allows to reproduce isotropic/anisotropic diffusion on a non-polarized fibers network.
Concerning chemotaxis, we shall consider a chemoattractant in the region Ω defined by a
strictly positive definite function
S = S(x) : Ω 7−→ R+. (28)
We consider that the sensing performed by the cells is non-local, as they may extend their
protrusions, through which they sense the environment, up to several cell diameters [3]. The
maximum length R of a protrusion is called sensing radius and it has been first introduced in
[40] for modeling a non-local gradient of a chemical and, then, used in a number of works (see
[10] for a review and references therein) for describing the sensing of macroscopic quantities. In
particular, in [36] and, later, in [37] the authors propose a double bias model, in which two cues
are sensed non-locally and they affect cell polarization and speed. In the present work we shall
drop the sensing of a cue that affects the speed, that will be unbiased, and we will extend the
model proposed in [36] to a double sensing of cues affecting the polarization of the cell.
Therefore, in the model both S and q will be sensed non-locally by a cell that, starting from
its position x, extends its protrusions in every direction vˆ ∈ S
d−1 up to the distance R, given by
the sensing radius. In particular, assuming a non-local sensing of the fibers network will allow to
reproduce a wider range of migration strategies, that a cell can perform in order to cleverly reach
the chemoattractant, with respect to a local sensing. Therefore, we shall consider the quantities
S(x + λvˆ), q(x + λvˆ, vˆ), ∀ x ∈ Ω, ∀ vˆ ∈ S
d−1
, λ ≤ R.
Of course, next to the border of the domain Ω, we shall always consider λ such that x + λvˆ ∈ Ω.
In order to analyze qualitatively the impact of the non-locality at the macroscopic level, we
study, as previously done in [36, 37], the impact of the directional cues S and q with respect to
the size of the cell, that is related to its sensing radius R. Thus, we introduce the characteristic
length of variation of S as
lS :=
1
max
x∈Ω
|∇S|
S
. (29)
It allows to approximate S(x + λvˆ) with a positive quantity
S(x + λvˆ) ∼ S(x) + λ∇S · vˆ ≥ 0 ∀λ ≤ R if R < lS (30)
where we neglected higher order terms in λ. Beside the above defined characteristic length of
variation of the chemoattractant lS , we define an analogue quantity for the fibers distribution. We
choose
lq :=
1
max
x∈Ω
max
vˆ∈S
d−1
|∇q·vˆ|
q
. (31)

In this case, we can approximate q(x + λvˆ, vˆ) with a positive quantity
q(x + λvˆ, vˆ) ∼ q(x, vˆ) + λ∇q · vˆ ≥ 0 ∀λ < R if R < lq . (32)
In particular, this definition of lq takes into account the variation of directionality of the fibers
in space, that is what actually influences the cell orientation, more than spatial variation of the
density of the extracellular matrix. We analyze the possible scenarios depending on the relation
between R, lS and lq.
In analogy to [36], let us now introduce the parameters
ηq :=
R
lq
(33)
and
ηS :=
R
lS
, (34)
that quantify the capability of measuring of the cell with respect to the characteristic lengths of
variation of the sensed guidance cues q and S. In particular, ηi < 1, i = q, S, means that the
sensing radius is smaller than the characteristic length of variation of q (S, respectively) and the
idea is that a single instantaneous sensing of the cell is not capable of catching the total spatial
variability of q (S, respectively), while if ηi > 1, i = q, S, the sensing radius is large enough in
order to capture the spatial variability of q (S, respectively). If we consider the two cues separately,
in the first case we expect that the sensing of q (S, respectively) induces a diffusive behavior, while
in the second scenario the overall behavior induced by q (S, respectively) is drift-driven.
As we are considering the two guidance cues simultaneously affecting cell polarization, we now
take into account for limit cases:
i) ηq, ηS  1;
ii) ηq, ηS  1;
iii) ηS  1, ηq  1;
iv) ηS  1, ηq  1.
In case i), a Taylor expansion cannot be used, since there is no guarantee that the first order
approximations are positive, as well as in case iii) and iv) for q and S, respectively.
In order to quantify the relative contribution of chemotaxis to contact guidance, we may
introduce the parameter
η =
ηq
ηS
(35)
that is larger than 1 if contact guidance prevails, whilst it is smaller then 1 if chemotaxis is
stronger. Due to (33) and (34), we have that, despite its definition, η does not depend on the size
and sensing capability of the cell, as η =
ηq
ηS
=
lS
lq
. In particular, if lS is larger than lq, i.e. η > 1,
it means that the gradient of q is steeper than the one of S, thus enhancing a stronger effect of
contact guidance on the dynamics. We may also observe that in case iii) we have always that
η > 1 while in case iv) we always have η < 1, i.e. contact guidance is weaker then chemotaxis.
We shall propose two different transition probabilities describing two different sensing strategies: in the first model the sensings of q and S are independent, while in the second model a
unique sensing is performed. In the first model, we shall introduce a transition probability that is
the product of two different independent sensings
T[q, S](x, v, vˆ) = c(x)
Z
R+
γS (λ)S(x + λvˆ) dλ Z
R+
γq(λ) q(x + λvˆ, vˆ) dλ ψ(v). (36)
In this case the cell located in position x measures along the direction vˆ the field S(x+λvˆ) weighted
by γS , and, independently, the quantity q(x + λvˆ, vˆ), weighted by γq. The sensing functions γS
9
and γq have compact support in [0, R] and they may be Dirac deltas centered in R, if the cell only
measures the guidance cues on its membrane (only on x + Rvˆ for every vˆ), or Heaviside functions
if the cell measures and gives the same weight to q and S from x to x + Rvˆ in every direction.
Formally the transition probability might be seen as the product of the independent probabilities
of q and S, i.e. T[q, S] = Tˆ[q] Tˆ[S].
The second model prescribes a simultaneous averaging of the guidance cues S and q, i.e.,
T[q, S](x, v, vˆ) = c(x)
Z
R+
γ(λ)S(x + λvˆ) q(x + λvˆ, vˆ)dλ ψ(v). (37)
This transition probability describes a cells in position x that measures in the direction vˆ the two
quantities S(x + λvˆ) and q(x + λvˆ), weighting both with γ, that is a sensing function. Formally,
as the two sensing are not independent and, therefore, factorized, we have a conditioning of S
given q and viceversa, i.e., T[q, S] = T˜[S|q] T˜[q] = T˜[q|S] T˜[S].
In (36) and (37), c(x) is a normalization coefficient. Moreover the probability density ψ is the
distribution of the speeds on the interval [0, U] and satisfies
Z U
0
ψ(v)dv = 1 .
We introduce its mean speed
U¯ =
Z U
0
v ψ(v) dv (38)
and the second moment
D =
Z U
0
v
2 ψ(v) dv , (39)
such that the variance of ψ is given by σ
2
ψ =
1
2
(D − U¯ 2
).
We shall refer to the transport model (5)-(9) with (36) as non-local independent sensing model,
in which the cell averages the two cues independently according to two different sensing functions
γq, γS . On the other hand, the transport model (5)-(9) with (37) is defined as non-local dependent
sensing model, describing cells that sense the two cues at the same time and average them with a
unique sensing kernel γ. In the next sections we shall analyze the macroscopic limits for the two
models in the scenarios i) − iv) and we shall compare the two models.
3.1 Amoeboid motion and chemotaxis: non-local independent sensing
We first consider the non-local independent sensing case (5)-(9) with (36). We recall the expression
of the transition probability

γS (λ)S(x + λvˆ) dλ Z

As a consequence of the fact that T cannot be expanded in powers of  after re-scaling with (14),
we have that U0
T = UT given by (40). Therefore, we have to perform a hyperbolic scaling that
leads to the following macroscopic equation for the cells macroscopic density:
∂
∂τ ρ(τ, ξ) + ∇ · (ρ(τ, ξ)UT (ξ)) = 0 , (41)
with UT (ξ) given by the re-scaling of (40) with (14).
Case ii) In this case, we can expand both S(x + λvˆ) and q(x + λvˆ, vˆ) and consider the approximations (30) and (32) for λ < min{lq, lS }. Therefore, we approximate the transition probability
by substituting (30) and (32) in (36), and, thus, we obtain the following approximation for the
turning kernel T[q, S], that reads

We can, then, introduce the small parameter
 = min{ηq, ηS } (43)
and re-scale the space variable as ξ = x, getting
T0[q, S](ξ, v, vˆ) = q(ξ, vˆ)ψ(v), (44)
meaning that the equilibrium is determined by the fibers distribution, and

Because of (27) and (44), we have that UT

are the sensitivities. The diffusion represented by the motility tensor of the cells (45) only depends
on the fibers distribution, while the advective term has two contributions differently weighted by
the sensitivities (48). We remark that, in this regime, we obtain the same macroscopic behavior
postulated by Keller and Segel [29], with the logarithmic chemotactic sensitivity χS given in
(48). The term Dq∇S depends on both the fibers distribution and the chemotactic field; it never
vanishes if ∇S is not the null vector, since it may be proved that Dq is invertible. In the case
of randomly disposed fibers, corresponding to the isotropic case, i.e., when Dq is proportional to
the identity matrix, then Dq∇S is parallel to ∇S, that, thus, represents the anisotropy direction.
On the other hand, when Dq is anisotropic, if ∇S is not parallel to the eigenvector corresponding
to the highest eigenvalue of Dq, then the migration does not follow the dominant direction of the
fibers, but rather its projection on ∇S. Moreover, the second contribution in the drift term, i.e.,
∇ · Dq, is a measure of the velocity field induced by the spatial variation of the distribution of
the fiber directions, that determines the microscopic velocities of the cells. This term vanishes if
the fibers distribution is homogeneous in space. Therefore, if q is homogeneous in space, even in
case of competing cues, i.e., Eq ⊥ ∇S, in general the advective term U1
T does not vanish, while
in case of cooperating cues, i.e., ∇S is an eigenvector of Dq with eigenvalue D∇S , migration is in
direction ∇S with a kinetic factor χS D∇S . In intermediate scenarios, migration happens in the
projection Dq∇S, but, if q is not homogeneous, the dynamics is more complex and, even in case
of cooperation, we cannot conclude anything about additivity effects.
Case iii) In this case, we can only expand with Taylor series the chemoattractant, as in (30),
and the turning kernel (36) may be approximated as

We have defined the chemotactic sensitivity as

that is a function of the chemical alone, as it is the cue inducing a diffusive behavior. Here, the
advection velocity is related to a non-local average of the diffusion tensor of the fibers D¯ 0
q projected on ∇S, and it cannot be decomposed into two contributions because of the large size of the
cell with respect to the spatial variability of the fibers distribution. Therefore, in this case the
additivity effect of the two cues is not evident and the possible scenarios are many more.
Remark If we consider γq = δ(λ − 0) we obtain a local sensing of fibers. Without chemotaxis we
would have the classical model for contact guidance [24], that gives rise, at the macroscopic level,
to a fully anisotropic diffusive equation. The presence of a non-local chemoattractant, even when
R < lS , gives rise to a drift correction term proportional to Dq∇S.
Case iv) The last case allows only for the Taylor expansion of the distribution function q, as in
(32). Therefore, the turning kernel may be approximated as

and the macroscopic equation is given by (23). The mean velocity (56) is a linear combination of
a non-local measure of the chemoattractant S over the fibers network and a non-local measure of
S weighted by the directional average of the spatial variability of the fiber direction.
Remark If we consider a local sensing for the chemoattractant, i.e. γS = δ(λ − 0), we obtain a
macroscopic advection-diffusion equation, where the macroscopic velocity is induced by the spatial
variation of the distribution of fiber directions ∇ · Dq, and the measure of S does not affect the
choice of the direction. In this case, if ∇q vanishes, the model reduces to a fully anisotropic
diffusive equation [24].
3.2 Amoeboid motion and chemotaxis: non-local dependent sensing
Concerning the non-local dependent sensing case (5)-(9) with (37), we recall the expression of the
transition probability
T[q, S](x, v, vˆ) = c(x)
Z
R+
γ(λ)S(x + λvˆ) q(x + λvˆ, vˆ)dλ ψ(v),

vˆ
Z
R+
γ(λ)S(x + λvˆ) q(x + λvˆ, vˆ)dλ dvˆ . (57)
The macroscopic limits can be performed as in the previous section and the choice of the parameter
 will be the same for the cases i)−iv), since it does not depend on the kind of model (independent
or dependent sensing), but only on ηS and ηq.
Case i) In this case we cannot consider the expansions (32) and (30), and, thus, we cannot
expand the turning kernel, whose non vanishing average is given by (57). Therefore, we perform
a hyperbolic limit leading to (23) with macroscopic velocity (57).
14
Case ii) When, instead, the maximum sensing radius R is smaller than both the characteristic
lengths, we may consider the positive expansions (32) and (30) and substitute them in (37).
Neglecting the higher order terms in λ, we get the approximation
T[q, S](x, v, vˆ) = c(x)
h
S(x) Γ0 q(x, vˆ) + S(x) Γ1 ∇q · vˆ + Γ1 q(x, vˆ) ∇S · vˆ

and

Re-scaling the space variable as in (14), we find

T1[q, S](ξ, v, vˆ) = Γh

Therefore, UT

and to the macroscopic first-order velocity
U1
T

Similar considerations to the case ii) of the non-local independent sensing model may be done,
except that there is a unique sensitivity χ that weights equally the two contributions to the
advection term (60).
Case iii) In this case, we expand only the chemoattractant S(x+λvˆ), as in (30), and the turning
kernel (37) can be approximated as

3.2.1 Comments
We can observe that, if γq = γS = γ = δ(λ−R), the two non-local transport models for independent
and dependent sensing are the same, while, if the sensing kernels are not dirac deltas (even if
γq = γS = γ), the transport models are always different. Instead, at the macroscopic level, with
any choice of the sensing functions the models coincide only in case ii). In this case, in fact, the
macroscopic limits are different only if γq 6= γS , while in the cases iii) and iv) they are different if
the sensing kernel are not dirac deltas (even if γS = γq = γ). The relevant difference concerns the
macroscopic transport velocities (see (54) and (65) for the case iii, and (56) and (68) for the case
iv). In fact, in the cases iii) and iv), for the non-local dependent sensing model, as only one cue
is considered non-locally and both cues are averaged with the same sensing function γ, we have a
weighted average on λ of the non-local quantities, that results in the weighted averages (65) and
the second term of (68). These remarks are summarized in Table 2.

4 Numerical simulations
We shall now propose two-dimensional numerical simulations in order to illustrate the behavior of
the kinetic transport models for non-local independent sensing and non-local dependent sensing.
In particular, we shall integrate numerically the transport equation as in [36] and, then, we shall
compute the macroscopic density (1). Concerning the fibers network, a classical used distribution
is the Von Mises distribution [39]
q˜(x, vˆ) = 1
2πI0(k(x)) e
k(x) u(x)·vˆ
where Iν(k) is the modified Bessel function of first kind of order ν and
u(x) = (cos(θq(x)),sin(θq(x))).
It can be proved that Eq˜(x) = u(x) [25], and, therefore, θq(x) is the mean direction in the
space [0, 2π) of the fibers located at point x. As we are dealing with cell migrating on a nonpolarized network of fibers, we shall consider the symmetric version, namely the Bimodal Von
Mises distribution

4.1 Test 1: local ECM sensing and non-local chemotaxis
As a first example, we shall present the particular case in which the sensing of q is local. This
illustrates the effect of a second directional cue when dealing with a cell population migrating by
contact guidance and evaluating the local alignment of the fibers over a non-polarized network.
Formally, we are dealing with (36) in which γq = δ(λ−0). In particular, we shall consider a region
Ωq = {x = (x, y) ∈ Ω s.t. x1 ≤ x ≤ x2} (69)
with x1 = 1.8 and x2 = 3.2 in which the fibers are strongly aligned along the direction identified
by θq = π/2. In particular, for (x, y) ∈ Ωq, k(x, y) = 700, such that Dq = 5 · 10−3
. In the rest of
the domain Ω − Ωq fibers are uniformly distributed. The chemoattractant has a Gaussian profile

In particular, in Test 1 (see Fig. 1) we choose (xS , yS ) = (4, 4), mS = 10, σ2

with r0 = 0.1 and σ

0 = 0.1. In this first test, the initial condition for the cell population is centered
in (x0, y0) = (2.5, 2.5), i.e., the center of the region Ωq (see Fig. 1a). Without chemoattractant,
because of the presence of highly aligned fibers, we would expect that cells diffuse anisotropically
in the preferential direction of the fibers ±π/2, forming the well known ellipsis [43], that represents
cells moving with the same probability along direction π/2 and −π/2. In the present case, due to
the presence of a chemoattractant, the symmetry is broken, and, even if q describes a non-polarized
fibers network, there is a preferential sense of motion (see Fig. 1d-1f). In particular, cells migrate
along the fibers in the direction identified by θq = π/2, corresponding to the preferential sense
imposed by the presence of the chemoattractant in the upper-right corner of the domain Ω. Given
this directional setting, the cell population dynamics is also greatly affected by the strength of the
chemoattractant, that depends on mS and σ
2
S
, the degree of the alignment Dq, that depends on
k(x, y), and by the sensing radius R. Another important aspect is the sensing function γS , that
influences the transient dynamics and, especially, the relaxation time. This appears to be double
in the case of a Heaviside function, since the kernel γS doubles when computed with a Heaviside
function instead of a Dirac delta (see also [36]).

We also analyzed the average polarization of the cells at every position x, that is given by
the momentum (2). The microscopic directions of cells are initially randomly distributed and
they start from a vanishing initial speed (see Fig. 1b). Then, they start to align along the
fibers and to migrate upward in the direction individuated by the angle π/2, since cells sense the
chemoattractant (see Figs. 1g-1h). Eventually when cells reach the level y = 4, the microscopic
directions polarize towards the chemoattractant (see Fig. 1i). The center of mass plotted in Fig.
1c stays in the region Ωq during the migration of cells along the fibers bundle in Ωq, and it moves
out of Ωq only when it reaches y = 4. The black dots are plotted every ∆t = 1 and it is clear
that the highest acceleration happens when cells are on the bundle of fibers, while they are slowed
down when they start to move out of the fibers stripe Ωq.
4.2 Test 2: non-local ECM sensing and chemotaxis
As a second test, we present both the non-local independent sensing model and the non-local
dependent sensing model. We shall now consider a non-local sensing of the distribution of fibers.
In particular, we assume fibers distributed similarly to the previous test, i.e., fibers shall be highly
aligned in Ωq given, this time, by x1 = 2.1 and x2 = 2.9 (see Fig. 2b). Here, for (x, y) ∈ Ωq,
k(x, y) = 100, that corresponds to Dq = 0.0025, and θq(x, y) = π/2. In the region Ω−Ωq fibers are
uniformly distributed. The initial condition of the cell population is (71) with in (x0, y0) = (1, 0.5)
(see Fig. 2a) while the chemoattractant is located as in Test 1, with mS = 10 and σ
2
S = 0.05. We
shall compare the dynamics of the cells in four settings:
1. local fiber distribution and non-local chemoattractant, as in Test 1, i.e., (36) with γq =
δ(λ − 0) and γS = δ(λ − R);
2. non-local sensing with a Dirac Delta for both q and S; this corresponds to both (36) and
(37) with γq = γS = γ = δ(λ − R);
3. non-local independent sensing with Heaviside sensing functions for both S and q, i.e., (36)
with γq = γS = H(R − λ);
4. non-local dependent sensing for q and S, dealing with (37) and γ = H(R − λ).
Results of these simulations are shown in Fig. 2. We can observe that, in the 1-4 settings, cells start
from (1, 0.5), they are attracted by the chemoattractant and, on their way towards S, they cross
the aligned fibers region Ωq and climb up this region in the direction π/2. Eventually, in all the
cases, cells reach the chemoattractant, but the dynamics, as well as the transient time, is influenced
by the different sensing kernels, even though the differences are not extremely appreciable, and
by the local or non-local sensing strategy. Although settings 3 and 4 in Fig. 2, that are related to
the case of independent and dependent cues, respectively, do not show very strong differences, in
case 3 (see Figs. 2k-2n) the tendency of going in both the direction π/2, determined by the fibers,
and π/4, determined by the chemoattractant, appears more marked because of the independent
sensing. In contrast, this behavior results the least evident in the case in which cells deal with a
local sensing of the fibers (setting 1), resulting also in a general slow down of the dynamics.
4.3 Test 3. non-local independent sensing model: comparison of the
cases i) − iv)
We now present a comparison of the macroscopic behaviors of the cells, depending on the relation
between R, lS and lq, i.e., we compare the cases i), ii), iii) and iv). In particular, we shall do
this for the non-local independent sensing model with γq = γS = H(R − λ), as this is the case
in which the transport model is different from the dependent sensing model. Additionally, the
independence of the two sensings allows to visualize more efficiently the two distinct directional
effects (contact guidance and chemotaxis).

We shall consider the turning kernel describing contact guidance lead by a q with mean direction

consider different values of mk in order to obtain different values of lq: mk = 10 corresponds to
lq ≈ 0.031 and mk = 100 corresponds to lq ≈ 0.0031. Details about the estimation of lq for a
Bimodal Von Mises distribution of fibers q are given in Appendix A. The chemoattractant is (70)

In Fig. 4, we consider the case in which ηS , ηq  1, i.e., we are dealing with case i). The
macroscopic behavior is strongly hyperbolic with macroscopic velocity given by (40). In fact, in
Fig. 4 we can observe that the behavior is not diffusive and the cluster of cells is quite compact. Moreover, when cells reach the region in which fibers are strongly aligned in the direction
3π/4 (as shown in Fig. 3d), that is perpendicular to the favorable direction π/4 induced by the
chemoattractant, they surround that region inducing strong alignment and go over towards the
chemoattractant. In this setting, the parameter defined in (35) is slightly smaller then 1 and, in
fact, chemotaxis prevails in the overall dynamics, as the stationary state is clearly peaked on the
chemoattractant profile, but the fibers structure influences the transient.
In Fig. 5, we shall consider S with σ
2
S = 1.8 and, consequently, lS = 0.25 (see Fig. 3c).
Concerning the fibers, we have mk = 100, so that lq ≈ 0.0031, and the sensing radius is R = 0.7.
This setting falls again in case i), but the behavior is different with respect to the previous
simulation in Fig. 4. The chemoattractant in Fig. 3c, in fact, is spread over the whole domain
and, actually, the quantity lS is almost 102
times the lS considered in Fig. 3a and used for the
simulation in Fig. 4. Even though we are still in a strongly hyperbolic case and cells are guided
by the strong drift (40), as R is slightly larger then lS and lS is large, the cell cluster diffuses a bit
more in the domain. When it reaches the region of strongly aligned fibers, it starts to surround
that region (see Figs. 5a-5c), but, as ηS = 2.8 = O(1), some cells, that do not surround the region,
are slowed down and partially tend to align along the fibers. In Fig. 5d, for instance, we have a
high density of cells both in the strongly aligned fiber region and in the region of high density of
chemoattractant. Eventually, cells manage to overcome the area of highly aligned fibers and they
tend to converge to the chemoattractant profile (see Figs. 5e-5f). Now, the the overall dynamics
is greatly affected by the fibers and, in fact, η  1.
The second scenario, illustrated in Fig. 6, refers to the case ii), since the sensing radius
R = 0.02 is smaller than both lS = 0.055 and lq ≈ 0.031. At the macroscopic level, the behavior

of the system is described by the diffusion-advection equation (47) with macroscopic velocity (46).
Actually, in Fig. 6 we can observe a highly diffusive behavior, as the macroscopic density of cells
has invaded almost the half of the domain before even starting to be influenced by the fibers. If
we compare the same time step in Figs. 6b and 5b, we see that the cells are in both cases reaching
the fibers and feeling the region in which fibers are aligned the most. However, in Fig. 5b the cell
cluster is much more compact than in Fig. 6b, where, instead, cells already occupied half of the
domain, because of diffusion, and we have high density of cells both closely to the strongly aligned
fiber region and around the initial position. Therefore, cells start surrounding the central region
of strongly aligned fibers, because they already sense the chemoattractant, and, once overcome
this area, they tend to the chemoattractant profile (see Figs. 6c-6f). In particular, in the transient
time, cells accumulate the most at the sides of the region with highly aligned fibers. In this specific
setting, η > 1 and, in fact, contact guidance highly affects the dynamics.
The third scenario, illustrated in Fig. 7, refers to the case iii), since the sensing radius R = 0.02
is smaller than lS = 0.25 but it is larger then lq ≈ 0.0031. The macroscopic setting is described
by a diffusion-advection equation with diffusion tensor and drift velocity given by (53) and (54),
respectively. As ηS < 1, we have that the chemoattractant induces a strong diffusivity, but being
ηq > 1, the alignment of fibers strongly affects the dynamics (see Figs. 7c-7d). Comparing, in
addition, Figs. 6b and 7b, we have now that the highest cell concentration is in the mean fiber
direction θq = 3π/4 in the region surrounding the center of the domain, where the fibers are
aligned with a higher degree. As already observe in section 3, this scenario prescribes η  1 and,
in fact, contact guidance dominates again the dynamics.
Eventually, for a sensing radius R = 0.02 smaller than lq ≈ 0.031, but larger than lS = 0.002,
the macroscopic behavior is approximated by an hyperbolic equation with drift velocity given in
(56). Results of the simulation are presented in Fig. 8. Here, the chemoattractant has the profile

shown in Fig. 3a. Cells diffuse in the domain because ηq is smaller than 1, and they start moving
in a region with randomly disposed fibers (see Fig. 8a). Then, they mainly follow the preferential

4.4 Test 4: heterogeneous ECM environment
We now consider a domain Ω divided in several regions, each of them characterized by a different
average direction of the fibers. In particular, we shall do this in the case of independent sensing
model with γq = γS = H(R−λ), as for Test 3; the independence of the two sensings, in fact, allows
to visualize more efficiently the two distinct directional effects. As first scenario, we shall consider
the domain schematized in Fig. 9a; in each subdomain we have k(x, y) = 50, that corresponds
to Dq = 0.005. The initial condition of the cells is represented in Fig. 9c, with initial density
r0 = 0.1, while the chemoattractant has a gaussian profile (70) centered in (xS , yS ) = (4, 4), with
mS = 10 and σ
2
S = 0.5, as shown in Fig. 9b. We observe that cells do not migrate collectively
towards the chemoattractant, but they divide into two main separated clusters (see Figs. 9f -
9h): in fact, although the sensing radius R = 0.8 is quite large, the cells that are closer to the
left boundary remain trapped in the first subdomain, showing a loss of adhesion with the rest of
the cell population. As shown in Fig. 9i, even though the cells that are in the left subdomain
horizontally align to the chemoattractant, the high degree of alignment of the fiber does not allow
them to escape this region, even for large times.
As second scenario, we shall consider the domain represented in Fig. 10a; in each subdomain,
the parameter k(x, y) = 50. The initial condition of the cell population is (71) with (x0, y0) =
(4, 0.5) and r0 = 0.1, while the chemoattractant has a gaussian profile (70) centered in (xS , yS ) =
(2, 4.5) with mS = 10 and σ
2
S = 0.05, as shown in Fig. 10c and 10b, respectively. We observe that
cells do not migrate directly towards the chemoattractant, as they sense the heterogeneous fibrous
environment and, consequently, adapt their migration to it. In particular, cells that are able to
reach and sense the isotropic subdomain where the fibers are uniformly distributed (defined by
1 ≤ x ≤ 3 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 3), go in this direction imposed by the gradient of the chemoattractant.
On the other hand, in the subdomain 3 ≤ x ≤ 5 and 1 ≤ y ≤ 2, they follow the direction of
fiber alignment, that is π/4, perpendicular to the favorable direction imposed by S. However,
the sensing radius R = 0.7 allows the cells that are closer to the right boundary to escape quite
fast the disadvantageous (in terms of preferential direction) subdomains and, following firstly the
direction π/2 in 2 ≤ y ≤ 3 and, then, 3π/4 in 3 ≤ y ≤ 4, to reach the chemoattractant.

5 Conclusion
We have proposed a kinetic model for describing cell migration in a multi-cue environment. In
particular, in the same spirit as [36], we have considered that cells, as they can extend protrusions
up to several cell diameters, perform a non-local sensing of the environment up to a distance R
(named the sensing radius) from its nucleus. In the present model, there are two guidance cues
affecting the polarization, and, therefore, the direction of motion of the cells: contact guidance,
that is a bi-directional cue, and a chemical gradient, that is a mono-directional cue. We remark
that for the first time in this work a non-local sensing in the physical space of the mesoscopic
distribution of fibers is considered. In particular, we introduced two classes of models: in the first
one, the cells perform an independent sensing of the fibers and of the chemical in its neighborhood,
while in the second class of models the cells average the chemical and the fibers with the same
sensing kernel.
In the two cases, a particular attention was devoted to the identification of the proper macroscopic limit according to the properties of the turning operator. We detected two parameters, ηq
and ηS , that measure the relation between the cell sensing radius and the characteristic lengths
of variation − lS and lq − of the two cues, and discriminate between a diffusion-driven regime
with an advective correction and a drift-driven regime. In particular, when the sensing radius
does not exceed the characteristic length of the chemoattractant, the bi-directional nature of the

fibers allows for a diffusive regime; otherwise the hyperbolic scaling leads to macroscopic drift.
A common feature in the different cases is the dependency of the macroscopic velocity on both
the fibers network and the chemoattractant. This aspect enhances the non-trivial influence of
contact guidance on the cell drift, although we considered a non polarized fibers network. This
interdependence is in accordance with the model proposed in [58]. Moreover, in absence of a
chemoattractant, this impact on the drift term could persist for spatial heterogenous fiber distributions. This is in accordance to what is observed in [24] and it represents a step forward with
respect to [58], in which the drift is a function of contact guidance only through to the presence
of a chemical gradient, i.e., without chemoattractant there will be no drift.
The numerical simulations of the transport model pointed out the main features characterizing
the two classes of models and the possible scenarios that they are able to capture. We observed
that the presence of two cues influencing cell polarization, even when the fibers are sensed locally,
ensures a preferential sense of motion for cells laying on regions of highly aligned non-oriented
fibers. Test 3 allowed to show the importance of deriving the macroscopic equations from an underlying microscopic dynamics and in the appropriate regime: a directly postulated drift-diffusion
equation would not capture the exact dynamics in all the possible regimes. The competitive or
collaborative effects of the cues depend, in a first instance, on the angle between their relative
orientations, i.e., the direction of fiber alignment θq and the gradient of the chemoattractant.
28
Moreover, especially for the cases of competitive cues, determining which one is the dominant
cue depends on their relative strengths, in terms of both concentration and intensity (degree of
alignment of the fiber k(x) or steepness of the chemoattractive gradient). We introduced the
parameter η = lS /lq that, independently on the cell size or its sensing capability, quantifies the
relative contribution of guidance to chemotaxis and provide a first separation between the cases
of fiber-dominating and chemotaxis-dominating dynamics (η  1 or η  1, respectively). The
presented framework also allows for the direct calculation of parameters that can be used to quantify directed cell migration and to set its efficiency, like, for instance, mean square displacement,
persistence time, directional persistence and mean speed [42].
Additionally, the non locality brings an further level of detail to the model, allowing to obtain
different macroscopic behaviour depending on the characteristics of the two sensing. In fact, we
did not observe strong differences between the independent and the dependent sensing models,
when we assume in the former the same sensing kernel for fibers and chemoattractant, i.e., when
γq = γS . However, if there are biological observations sustaining the possibility that a cell might
implement different strategies for sensing the underlying fibers network and the chemoattractant,
it would be possible to use the proposed model, in its independent sensing version, to investigate
this scenario and to compare the possible outcomes of this sensing approach with the case of a
unique and common sensing strategy.
Potentially, the case of competitive cues, combined with the non-local aspect of the model,
could lead to interesting further analysis. As observed in the last numerical tests, the combination
of heterogenous landscapes of fiber with chemoattractive agents show how the cell density can
divide and cross the domain using different migration strategies. This leads to natural questions
about the deeper mechanisms leading the competition between the two cues, considering, for
instance, the possible role of cell adhesion in recovering collective migration.
We remark that, even if simulations were performed in a two dimensional setting, the transport model (and its macroscopic limits, as a consequence) is formulated in a general d-dimensional
setting. Hence, a possible future development is to perform simulations in the three dimensional
case, that would be much more realistic for mimicking in-vivo migration of cells in the extracellular
matrix. Moreover, the model that we proposed may be adapted to describe other directional cues
that might describe, among others, haptotactic, durotactic or electrotactic mechanisms. Furthermore, in the same spirit as in [37] we could enrich this model with a non-constant sensing-radius,
as it may vary according to the spatial and directional variability of the external guidance cues.
Lastly, this study was restricted to the case in which the cues affect only cell polarization, considering a uniform distribution of the speeds. However, similarly to what is done in [36, 37], it may
be modified to model a multi-cue environment in which one of the signals affects also the speed
of the cells.
A Estimation of lq
